                The Pierre Toussaint Scholarship Fund provides students like us with the financial,
                spiritual and professional assistance in our academic career. We, PTS scholars, are forever grateful
                for our opportunities and want to raise funding to help PTS in continuing their thoughtful service. Our fundraiser will
                open from April 14, 2021 to April 18, 2021 and our goal is $300, but more assistance is welcome. Please help us shatter this
                limit and help other students like us to succeed and prosper!

            We are currently running a fundraiser! Do you love gourmet popcorn and helping deserving
            college students? If so, please consider purchasing popcorn from my pop-up shop link. Your
            purchase helps the Venerable Pierre Toussaint
            Program which provides scholarships to students with
            high academic performance who are engaged in their
            community, and dedicated to their Catholic faith.
            Additionally, 10% of your purchase goes to the
            programâ€™s Food Pantry Committee which allocates
            funding to local parish food pantries.
