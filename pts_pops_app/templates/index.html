        We are currently running a fundraiser! Do you love gourmet popcorn and helping deserving
        college students? If so, please consider purchasing
        popcorn from my pop-up shop link: <a href="https://popup.doublegood.com/s/uh5jd708">Justin&Jason's Pop-Up Store</a> . Your
        purchase helps the Venerable Pierre Toussaint
        Program which provides scholarships to students with
        high academic performance who are engaged in their
        community, and dedicated to their Catholic faith.
        Additionally, 10% of your purchase goes to the
        programâ€™s Food Pantry Committee which allocates
        funding to local parish food pantries.
